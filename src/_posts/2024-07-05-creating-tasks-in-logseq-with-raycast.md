If you use [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) for task management and also use
[Raycast](https://raycast.com/), I've got good news for you. I recently added an
"Add a Task" action to the [Logseq plugin](https://www.raycast.com/futantan/logseq).
Bind it to a key to get quick access to creating a task in today's journal. There is also
a "Task Scopes" option where you can provide a comma separated list of scopes like "home",
"work", "school", etc... If you provide scopes you'll get a dropdown of scopes to choose from
when creating a task and the task will get tagged with that scope. This fits nicely into the
task management process I outlined in
