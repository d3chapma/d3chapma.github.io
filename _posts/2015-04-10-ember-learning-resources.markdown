This post is intended to be a repository of great resources for getting the most out of Ember. I will do my best to revise this every few months to make source it is only referencing up-to-date material. If you have any other suggestions for things that I have missed, drop them in the comments and I'll add them.

Official Resources
===========================

[Ember Guides](http://guides.emberjs.com/): A great place to get started. I recommend reading through the guides as you start to build an app. After you read about a new feature, try using it in your app to solidfy the concept. 

[Ember API](http://emberjs.com/api/): Barebones documentation covering the entire API. This is the place to look if you want to learn about a specific function that Ember provides and it's signature. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be versioned yet, though no methods are removed or changed, so this shouldn't really be a problem until Ember 2.0.

[Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/): Documentation for Ember CLI. If you need to improve your understanding of what Ember CLI provides, or need to any sort of customization through addons, this is the place to start.

Conference/Meetup Talks
=======================

[Confreaks.tv](http://confreaks.tv/tags/127): A wealth of great content here. Definitely check this out no matter your experience with Ember.

Screencasts
===========

[Embercasts](http://www.emberscreencasts.com/): Have not used this much myself, but as far as I can tell it is the only active screencast series in the Ember community.

Podcasts
========

[Ember Weekend](https://emberweekend.firebaseapp.com/): Weekly podcast that is currently only three weeks in. Touches on many small news topics in under 10 minutes.

[Ember.Land](http://ember.land/): New episode every two weeks. Features Robert Jackson from the Ember Core team. Comes in at under 20 minutes per episode.

[Frontside](https://frontsidethepodcast.simplecast.fm/): This one is not officially Ember focused, but it tends to come up a lot. They cover other technology related topics as well. Usually runs around 30-40 minutes.

Books
=====

[Ember-CLI 101](https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101): A great book for getting started with Ember. Gets updates regularly.

Newsletters
===========

[Ember Weekly](http://emberweekly.com/): A must-use resource. Sign up to receive via email or just check in every Monday. Includes links to the latest Ember releases, blog posts relating to Ember, videos and podcasts, meetups/events, etc. Definitely the most important resource here if you want to stay on top of the latest Ember trends.
